/**
 * Interface that exposes the (existential) rule reasoning capabilities of a
 * Reasoner. <br>
 * The <b>knowledge base</b> of the reasoner can be loaded with explicit facts
 * and <b>existential rules</b> that would infer implicit <b>facts</b> trough
 * reasoning. <br>
 * <b>Facts</b> can be added to the knowledge base:
 * <ul>
 * <li>as in-memory Java objects ({@link Fact})</li>
 * <li>from a persistent data source ({@link DataSourceDeclaration})</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Rules</b> added to the knowledge base can be re-written internally by
 * VLog, using the corresponding set {@link RuleRewriteStrategy}. <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * The loaded reasoner can perform <b>atomic queries</b> on explicit and
 * implicit facts after calling {@link Reasoner#reason()}. Queries can provide
 * an iterator for the results ({@link #answerQuery(PositiveLiteral, boolean)},
 * or the results can be exported to a file
 * ({@link #exportQueryAnswersToCsv(PositiveLiteral, String, boolean)}). <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Reasoning</b> with various {@link Algorithm}s is supported, that can lead
 * to different sets of inferred facts and different termination behavior. In
 * some cases, reasoning with rules with existentially quantified variables
 * ({@link ExistentialVariable}) may not terminate. We recommend reasoning with
 * algorithm {@link Algorithm#RESTRICTED_CHASE}, as it leads to termination in
 * more cases. To avoid non-termination, a reasoning timeout can be set
 * ({@link Reasoner#setReasoningTimeout(Integer)}). <br>
