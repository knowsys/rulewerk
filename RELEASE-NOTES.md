VLog4j Release Notes
====================

VLog4j v0.4.0
-------------

Breaking changes:
* The Reasoner interface has changed (knowledge base and related methods moved to KnowledgeBase) 
* The EdbIdbSeparation is obsolete and does no longer exist
* IRIs loaded from RDF inputs no longer include surrounding < > in their string identifier
* A new interface Fact has replaced the overly general PositiveLiteral in many places

New features:
* New own syntax for rules, facts, and data sources to create knowledge bases from files or strings in Java
* Input predicates can now be used with multiple sources and in rule heads (no more EDB-IDB distinction) 
* New InMemoryDataSource for efficient in-memory fact loading
* New KnowledgeBase class separates facts, data sources, and rules from the actual Reasoner
* Modifications to the knowledge base are taken into account by the reasoner 
* New and updated example programs to illustrate use of syntax

Other improvements:
* Query results now indicate their guaranteed correctness (example: answers can be incomplete when setting a timeout)
* Faster and more memory-efficient loading of facts
* Better error reporting; improved use of exceptions
* Better logging, especially on the INFO level
* Better code structure and testing

Bugfixes:
* Several reasoning errors in VLog (backend) have been discovered and fixed in the version used now 


VLog4j v0.3.0
-------------
